##  2. <a name='Dependencies'></a>Dependencies
The creation of an OZ interactive experience depends on a few Unreal Engine plugins:

-------------------
|name|tested version|
|--|--|
|Unreal Engine|v4.26
|[glTFRuntime](https://github.com/rdeioris/glTFRuntime)|
|[udp-ue4](https://github.com/getnamo/udp-ue4)|v1.0.0|
|[socketio-client-ue4](https://github.com/getnamo/socketio-client-ue4)|v1.5.5


##  3. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation

###  3.1. <a name='Dependencies-1'></a>Dependencies

* Copy the specified dependencies into the Plugins directory of your project, along with the OZ Plugin.
* Open your project. In some cases, an error saying that one of your plugins was built with a different version of the editor might appear. If this is the case, refer to [Important Additional Information](#important-additional-information)
* In the top left corner, go into ``Edit > Plugins``. 

<figure>
<img alt="Edit plugins" src="./Doc/plugins.png"/>
</figure>

* Navigate to ``Networking`` and ensure ```Socket.IO Client``` and ```UDPWrapper``` are enabled.

<figure>
<img alt="Plugins" src="./Doc/plugins2.png"/>
</figure>

* Then navigate to ```Runtime``` and make sure ```glTFRuntime``` is enabled. 

<figure>
<img alt="Plugins" src="./Doc/plugins3.png"/>
</figure>
  
* The editor will now ask you to restart the engine. Do so.

###  3.2. <a name='OZ-Plugin'></a>OZ-Plugin

* In the ```Content Browser```, select ```View Options > Show Plugin Content```. Then, in the top left corner of the content browser, select the little menu icon. Now you should see a folder called OZFusion Content.

###  3.3. <a name='Addingmodels'></a>Adding models

* All models are stored in ```Content/Models```. Make sure to include both the ```_lod0.glb``` and ```_lod3.glb``` versions.

* Files must be copied to the correct directory using Windows Explorer, not imported via the Unreal Editor



##  4. <a name='Example'></a>Example

Checkout out the Example folder

##  5. <a name='FeatureOverview'></a>Feature Overview

The plugin features one type of placeholder object, ```AvatarPlaceholder``` which is a placeholder for an avatar to be populated by an actual avatar during run time.

There is also a communications controller that is required for live control of the scene when it is streaming to the OZ app, ```BP_AvatarWebController```.


###  5.1. <a name='AvatarPlaceholder'></a>AvatarPlaceholder


<figure>
<img alt="Placeholder" src="./Doc/placeholder.png"/>
</figure>

To load an avatar into the scene, drag AvatarPlaceholder from the content browser into the map.
The placeholder can then be given a set of tags.
The role tag gives an avatar a specific role in the environment.
* ``role:host`` - Only one avatar can be a host
* ``role:cohost``
* ``role:guest`` - Guests are not spawned but rather promoted from the rows of audience
* ``role:audience``
These role tags are mutually exclusive.

To specify a model and animation use the options presented in the details browser, but this should only be done for testing purposes, in production the models are all loaded under control of the web controller.

<img alt="Specify a model and animation" src="./Doc/animation.png"/>
</figure>


The avatar placeholder also exposes functions that can be called from blueprints or sequences:

* Spawn avatar
* Destroy avatar
* Animate

##  6. <a name='WebController'></a>Web Controller

###  6.1. <a name='Handlingcustomeventsviawebcontroller'></a>Handling custom events via web controller

<figure>
<img alt="Specify a model and animation" src="./Doc/customevent.png"/>
</figure>

The web controller allows the creation of custom events through an event dispatcher. To use this, instantiate the web controller in the level, and in the level, blueprint create an event dispatcher connected to the web controller.


###  6.2. <a name='InteractingviatheWebController'></a>Interacting via the Web Controller
If a Web Controller actor is placed into the scene, the scene can be manipulated via the network.

This process will be handled automatically on the computer running the live scene via the Kafka-unreal-gateway. Still, if you want to try spawning an avatar by yourself, you can download a program called [Packet Sender](https://packetsender.com/download#show). 
The Web Controller takes commands in the form of a string sent via UDP, with commas separating the command and each of the arguments it accepts.

Then, while the program is running press ``Send`` with the configurations shown in the image:

<figure>
<img alt="Web Controller example" src="./Doc/webcontroller.png"/>
</figure>

-------------------
|||
|--|--|
|**Address**|127.0.0.1|
|**Port**|3002|
|**UDP**| |

Don’t worry about the ``HEX`` field as that is filled in automatically.

The ASCII field contains the actual command, which in this case is ```spawnavatar,audience,0,gudjon``` - where ```spawnavatar``` represents the type of command, audience represents the avatar role, 0 represents the first slot and ``gudjon`` is the ID of the avatar that is to be spawned and is the same as when using the ``Filename`` field for ``Avatar``, and so to spawn a different avatar, change the ID to another one. Of course, the file still needs to exist within ``Content/Models/``.

Furthermore, if you want to control the animations of the spawned ``Web_Avatars``, the following command can be set in the ```ASCII``` field with the same settings as in the previous step: ``animation,host,0,snake``  - Where ``animation`` represents the type of command, ``host`` represents the role, ``0`` represents the first slot associated with the given role, and ``snake`` is the ID of one of the available animations to play. 

###  6.3. <a name='WebControllerCommands'></a>WebController Commands

##  8. <a name='Knownlimitations'></a>Known limitations

* There seems to be an incompatibility with some plugins, like the Megascan. As it now causes errors on compiling C++ plugin with the Megascan feature enabled.

* Make sure you have the .Net ‘Developer’ version installed on the latest Visual Studio.

##  9. <a name='ImportantAdditionalInformation'></a>Important Additional Information

In case you received an error saying that one of the plugins was built with a different version of the editor, refer to the following instructions:

* Create a new blank project with C++ instead of Blueprints. Close the project. In the > project’s folder, create a folder called Plugins. 

* Paste the plugin mentioned in the error message into this folder. Go back to the project folder itself and re-open the project. You will now receive a message saying that the plugin was built with a different version asking if you’d like to rebuild it. Select yes.

* When this process has finished, close this project. Now, copy the plugin itself and paste it back into Engine/Plugins/Runtime. You can now delete the new project, re-open your project and continue according to the instructions above.

* Need to enable Show Engine Content, to see the OZ Plugin.
